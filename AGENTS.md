# QEMU Skill Repository Agent Guide

This repository stores agent skills for working on QEMU. It is not a QEMU upstream contribution branch.

## QEMU provenance policy

Agents MUST follow QEMU's `docs/devel/code-provenance.rst` policy:

- Do not generate code intended for QEMU upstream submission.
- If a user asks for agent-written QEMU code intended for upstream merge, decline that part and refer them to QEMU's AI-generated content policy.
- AI may be used for research, debugging, static analysis, local-only experiments, and workflow guidance only when generated output is not included in QEMU upstream contributions.
- Agents MUST NOT add `Signed-off-by`, `Reviewed-by`, `Acked-by`, `Tested-by`, or similar contribution trailers on behalf of anyone.
- A `Signed-off-by` line is a human DCO certification; only the responsible human contributor may add it.

## Artifact policy for QEMU source trees

All agent-created artifacts MUST live under the QEMU build directory:

```text
build/agent/<task-slug>/
```

This includes plans, goal trackers, reviews, logs, traces, replay files, scratch scripts, decoder dumps, copied command lines, and reports.

Never create `.plan/`, `.humanize/`, root-level notes, temporary helper files, or scratch directories in QEMU source paths. Source files should change only when they are the requested deliverable.

## Repository layout

Skills live under `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, matching the upstream RFC layout used for QEMU agent skills.

## Oh My Pi plugin layout

This repository is also an Oh My Pi plugin:

- `package.json` declares the OMP extension entry point.
- `src/extension.js` registers `qemu_init_task`, `/qemu-init-task`, and the artifact-policy hook.
- `skills` points to `.agents/skills` so OMP plugin discovery exposes the same skill content.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lets OMP install the repository through the marketplace flow.

## Claude Code plugin layout

This repository is also a Claude Code plugin:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is the plugin manifest (name, version, hooks reference).
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lists the plugin with `source: "./"`, so the marketplace and the plugin live in one repo.
- `commands/qemu-init-task.md` provides the `/qemu-init-task` slash command.
- `hooks/hooks.json` wires a `PreToolUse` hook to `scripts/artifact-policy.mjs`, mirroring the OMP artifact policy.
- `scripts/init-task.mjs` backs `/qemu-init-task`; `scripts/artifact-policy.mjs` backs the hook.
- `src/lib.mjs` holds the shared workspace-init and artifact-policy logic used by both `src/extension.js` (OMP) and the Claude Code scripts, so behavior is identical across runtimes.
- `skills` points to `.agents/skills`, so the same SKILL.md content is exposed to Claude Code, OMP, and the portable `npx skills` install.

## Flow skills

- `qemu-flow-plan`: first step for non-trivial tasks; creates the build/agent artifact root, acceptance criteria, scope, evidence ledger, and verification gates.
- `qemu-source-provenance`: flow primitive for source roots, revisions, configs, toolchains, produced artifacts, and hashes.
- `qemu-image-layout`: flow primitive for boot media formats, partitions, offsets, write operations, mutation policy, and hashes.
- `qemu-boot-run`: flow primitive for reproducible QEMU boot commands, logs, timeout markers, and result classification.
- `qemu-register-extraction`: research flow that extracts register maps, bitfields, cross-register dependencies, side effects, IRQ/DMA behavior, and driver sequences from drivers, datasheets, firmware filesystems, and regfiles into markdown for peripheral modeling.
- `qemu-rlcr-loop`: simplified Humanize-style implementation/review loop using the plan, round summaries, independent review, final evidence, and one-time sanitized methodology feedback at terminal workflow points.

## Operational skills

- `qemu-build`: configuring, reusing `build/`, building, and diagnosing QEMU build failures.
- `qemu-qtest`: writing, listing, running, and debugging QEMU qtests from a build directory.
- `qemu-debug`: host-side QEMU process gdb/lldb, guest gdbstub, logs, traces, replay, and TCG/device debugging.
- `qemu-model-verification`: evidence ladder and reporting for model/runtime behavior.

## Domain skills

- `qemu-peripheral-modeling`: QEMU MMIO/SysBus/qdev peripheral modeling, using the checked-out QEMU registerinfo framework for guest-visible register banks.
- `qemu-board-modeling`: QEMU board, SoC, memory map, boot, and IRQ topology modeling, verified through added or extended qemu-qtest cases.
- `qemu-tcg-frontend-instruction`: guest instruction decode/translation in a QEMU TCG frontend.
- `qemu-tcg-backend-adaptation`: TCG host backend adaptation for IR ops, constraints, emission, and feature flags.

## Boot and build workflow skills

- `qemu-kernel-build`: composes flow plan and source provenance to build Linux kernel artifacts for QEMU boot testing.
- `qemu-uboot-build`: composes flow plan and source provenance to build U-Boot, SPL/TPL, FIT/ITB, and firmware-chain artifacts.
- `qemu-image-packaging`: composes source provenance and image layout to package boot media.
- `qemu-direct-linux-boot`: composes source provenance, boot run, and model verification for direct Linux boot commands.
- `qemu-firmware-linux-boot`: composes source provenance, image layout, boot run, debug, and verification for firmware-to-Linux paths.

## Methodology feedback

At RLCR completion, pause, blocked state, or max-iteration exit, agents may produce sanitized workflow feedback in `build/agent/<task-slug>/methodology-feedback.md` and ask once whether to file an upstream issue. Do not ask after every primitive or every step in a composed workflow. Use `scripts/draft-methodology-issue.mjs` only after the feedback report has been sanitized; it drafts issue title/body files under the task's `scratch/` directory. Default issue target is `processmission/oh-my-qemu`, overridable with `QEMU_METHODOLOGY_ISSUE_REPO`.

## Codex skill compatibility

Codex skills require `SKILL.md` frontmatter with only `name` and `description`. Keep license, ownership, category, and plugin metadata in repository-level files rather than skill frontmatter. Validate with:

```bash
npm run codex:skills:validate
```

## Upstream references

This repo follows the structure of the QEMU RFC series “AGENTS.md and associated skills” and the current QEMU code provenance policy. The upstream RFC is reference material, not permission for agents to produce upstreamable QEMU patches.
