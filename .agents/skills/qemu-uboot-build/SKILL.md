# QEMU U-Boot Build

Use this workflow when a QEMU task needs U-Boot, SPL, TPL, FIT, ITB, or firmware-chain artifacts.

## Primitive Composition

1. Use `qemu-flow-plan` for the task workspace.
2. Use `qemu-source-provenance` for U-Boot and every external binary input.
3. Build with the local U-Boot tree's board documentation.
4. Update `source-provenance.md` with all boot-stage outputs and hashes.
5. Hand off to `qemu-image-packaging` or `qemu-firmware-linux-boot`.

## Build Flow

Record:

- U-Boot source path, revision, and dirty state;
- board defconfig and any config fragments;
- architecture, cross compiler prefix, compiler version, and output directory;
- external dependencies such as BL31, TEE, firmware blobs, device trees, or DDR init binaries;
- output artifacts such as `spl/u-boot-spl`, `u-boot`, `u-boot.bin`, `u-boot.itb`, or platform-specific combined images;
- exact command, log path, and hashes.

## Command Shape

Use local documentation first. Typical U-Boot patterns are:

```bash
make O=<out> <board_defconfig>
make O=<out> CROSS_COMPILE=<prefix> -j$(nproc)
```

If a firmware chain requires environment variables such as `BL31`, record their resolved paths and hashes before building.

## Output Rules

- Treat each boot stage as a separate provenance item.
- Do not assume a combined image contains the expected stage; inspect and record the packaging command.
- If firmware reaches U-Boot but Linux does not boot, separate U-Boot command/environment issues from QEMU model issues.
